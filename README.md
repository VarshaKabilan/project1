Hi this my team first project
If your cloning this project, you can add any code and push
Even you can modify this readme file and raise pull request

Brief: We tought better to start something then thinking to start in future when we get good idea. So, we started it. Main motivation is add anything related to code daily, no matter how much busy your at least one word. This is how all projects going to be develop. Everything start from zero. But when we work constantly and put ideas and hardwork together, one day we will achieve our goal. Nothing comes easy in this world. If that was true everyonewould have became successfull people.

I read in book that every one get a lot of ideas in day and in their dreams but when they wake from sleep, they forget everything. On other hand some people put just less efforts and become success. Here, problem is success people start things and unsucessfull people just dream.

What is the meaning of git? 
It means stupid. Linus Torvalds described the tool as "the stupid content tracker"  as a random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command.
